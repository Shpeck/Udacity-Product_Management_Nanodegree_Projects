Case Study: DoorDash - Pioneering the Era of Automated Food Delivery

DoorDash is looking to automate food delivery using self-driving robots for trips that are less than 2 miles in order to reduce its operating costs and provide more reliable delivery times. The long term goal is that these delivery robots will navigate sidewalks fully autonomously. But initially, there may be times when manual intervention will be required. Your team has been tasked with building a tool for the operations team-- to view the status of deliveries and remotely take control of robots that need intervention (ie: rerouting).

This project consisted of 4 parts:
# 1. Pitch a Product Vision
My goal was to research this opportunity, create a pitch deck for the product, and then present it.

# 2. Run a Design Sprint

For this project, I went through [the stages of Design Sprint](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/overview) on my own by simulating some of the group activities (brainstorming and decision process). My goal was to develop a concept that would address an opportunity I have identified.

# 3. Manage the Product Development Process

For this project, I dealt with various scenarios that a PM typically faces or is expected to carry out during the development phase:

1. Create a test plan
2. Create a dogfood survey
3. Prioritize competing tasks
4. Run a Go / No Go launch meeting

# 4. Deliver a Product to the Market

For this project, I simulated a product launch. I developed the go-to-market strategy, outlined a launch plan, identified potential problems and defined the next iteration of the product.

*Post-launch data*

Week: Number of deliveries

week 1: 100

week 2: 300

week 3: 500

week 4: 500

week 5: 600

*Field Feedback:* The DoorDash Operations team is generally very happy with your product, but in about 25% of the deliveries with the robots, there are some issues. You believe that it is because the operations team misses some of the robots malfunction. What can you do to address this item?
